alert blocks the further rendering of the page. 
If a source exists in script tag it's inside script is not loaded. 
Script is a 2 sided tag.
async - script reading (downloading) and rendering takes place simultaenously. good for slow internet connections.
defer - execute the script after the rendering has taken place.
In JS a single line is read and executed first. "interprated scripting language"
let is common for any variable unlike java where you have to specify the type and then followed by value of that type.

Strongly typed language vs weakly typed language :
Restriction on data type is on the variable not on the value which defines the strongness or weakness of a language.
Strongly - java, c++.
weakly - 
Object x = 10;
x = "akshit";
the above code works in java so how is it strongly typed language?
Similarly if we take a void pointer in  c++ we can achieve the abve thing too which might make it weak too.
We have the choice to use the language weakly. Java has the option to be written strongly and weekly we can choose in between mmaking it strong.

Statically typed language vs dynamically typed language :
Some languages are compiled and some are not. 
Statically have a compiling step to check for errors relateed to data type checking.
JS is not static.
Javascript falls into a bucket of weak dynamically typed language.
