alert blocks the further rendering of the page. 
If a source exists in script tag it's inside script is not loaded. 
Script is a 2 sided tag.
async - script reading (downloading) and rendering takes place simultaenously. good for slow internet connections.
defer - execute the script after the rendering has taken place.
In JS a single line is read and executed first. "interprated scripting language"
let is common for any variable unlike java where you have to specify the type and then followed by value of that type.

Strongly typed language vs weakly typed language :
Restriction on data type is on the variable not on the value which defines the strongness or weakness of a language.
Strongly - java, c++.
weakly - 
Object x = 10;
x = "akshit";
the above code works in java so how is it strongly typed language?
Similarly if we take a void pointer in  c++ we can achieve the abve thing too which might make it weak too.
We have the choice to use the language weakly. Java has the option to be written strongly and weekly we can choose in between mmaking it strong.

Statically typed language vs dynamically typed language :
Some languages are compiled and some are not. 
Statically have a compiling step to check for errors relateed to data type checking.
JS is not static.
Javascript falls into a bucket of weak dynamically typed language. 

Day 2: 
Javascript has a data type function which enables us to treat functions as a variable.
String and character are stored as string in js. single or double always strings.
Integer and float are stored as data type number.
Properties of functions: 
interprator reads all the lines first and then executes. 
function definations are put at the top while running which is known as hoisting
lines to be executed are put in a queue. and after reading the file that queue is executed.
without hoisting performance would increase. But it would make it difficult to write code.
if a function or variable is defined using let then it cannot be used before the function defination.
let, const is the new introduction so it should be promoted for the use. Var is the older way.
Polymorphism : 
Function needs to be defined once and the logic can be changed according to the use.
undefined acts as a false case for an if condition which helps us in Polymorphism.
Passing 2 arguments in a function requiring one parameter is also fine. We can still access the second parameter in the second function.
arguments is not a keyword it gets created in every function. it is an array.
thus functions can be created without any actual arguments. and can be handeled using the arguments array.
either we can call functions in js or we can pass just the name and call that function in the js.
