Each Promise is created using the constructor which takes in a function as an argument with 2 variables => resolve and reject.
Async functions have callback functions which are called after the given task is completed.
When we resolve a promise it's state is made from pending to resolved and the then function can be called later.
Async functions need callbacks in the arguments. If we still dont know the manipulations to be performed after the function execution is completed I cannot write the callback function.
Promises saves us from this by providing us the option to give it a callback function after completion using then.
